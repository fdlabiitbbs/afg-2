Moreover, the CSJ allows for adjusting phase differences between the diaphragms, ranging from 0° to 180°, providing versatile modulation capabilities. The compact design of the CSJ enables easy integration into electronic components, aerodynamics flow control, mixing, and combustion applications.

The inventors propose focusing as a method to mitigate these destructive interactions in the near field, allowing vortices to evolve effectively, which results in achieving 50% enhancement in jet strength in the far field.

      "Our group is trying to understand the propulsive performance of multiple pitching foils. Our study highlighted that side-by-side arrangement of foils in still medium results in the formation of a deflected jet. The extent of jet deflection depends on the phase difference between the airfoils' oscillations and the frequency of oscillation. At lower frequencies of oscillation for a given phase difference, the deflection angle is higher. We observed that the initially deflected jet undergoes a switching process towards the centerline position after specific periods of pitching. This occurs when the vortices from the lower airfoil completely interact with the upper airfoil. Overall, trust can be significantly enhanced by maintaining an optimum phase difference between the pitching foils.",

      "The addition of an auxiliary small foil can significantly enhance the propulsive performance of the main foil. Based on vorticity dynamics, three main flow regimes are identified, depending on the vortex structures shed by the airfoils. The auxiliary airfoil's presence significantly alters the main airfoil's hydrodynamic characteristics, leading to considerable enhancements in thrust (up to 23%) and efficiency (up to 49.2%) compared to an isolated airfoil.",

In practical applications, the performance of such sensor probes is affected by the external field noise and low amplitude of the external field. In order to improve their real time performance in complex environments, the modulation or conditioning of their responses is a definite solution. In this regard, methods based on spatial signal processing or phase noise cancellation have been reported. However, amplification, attenuation of noise components and filtering using a single system remained elusive. ",
