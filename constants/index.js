Such applications demand an active flow control technique to manipulate the flow field to achieve the desired effects like turbulence enhancement and vortices. Existing flow control devices have limited scope due to their ineffectiveness in manipulating the flow field to achieve these desired effects.",

            "We proposed and demonstrated a Coaxial Synthetic Jet (CSJ) system for flow control application. By employing two piezo-electric diaphragms arranged coaxially with a 0° orientation angle, the system generates and controls flow jets to achieve the desired effect. These diaphragms can be independently operated at different amplitudes and frequencies without affecting the flow in either cavity. Moreover, the CSJ allows for adjusting phase differences between the diaphragms, ranging from 0° to 180°, providing versatile modulation capabilities. The compact design of the CSJ enables easy integration into electronic components, aerodynamics flow control, mixing, and combustion applications. With its ability to achieve different mass flux ratios, the CSJ represents a significant advancement in flow control technology.",

SJs often suffer from reduced vortex coherence, limiting their wide applicability. This issue also affects Synthetic Jet Arrays (SJ arrays) composed of multiple adjacent actuators, where destructive interactions between opposite rotating vortices decrease coherence in the far field. The inventors propose focusing as a method to mitigate these destructive interactions in the near field, allowing vortices to evolve effectively, which results in achieving 50% enhancement in jet strength in the far field. Subsequently, constructive merging between vortices amplifies the jet strength in the far field. This novel focusing of SJs holds tremendous potential for enhancing electronic cooling, aerodynamics, and other applications."

By emulating the exceptional locomotion abilities of animals and microorganisms, we aim to engineer more efficient, agile, and sustainable propulsion systems.",

            "Our group is trying to understand the propulsive performance of multiple pitching foils. Our study highlighted that side-by-side arrangement of foils in still medium results in the formation of a deflected jet. The extent of jet deflection depends on the phase difference between the airfoils' oscillations and the frequency of oscillation. At lower frequencies of oscillation for a given phase difference, the deflection angle is higher. We observed that the initially deflected jet undergoes a switching process towards the centerline position after specific periods of pitching. This occurs when the vortices from the lower airfoil completely interact with the upper airfoil. Overall, trust can be significantly enhanced by maintaining an optimum phase difference between the pitching foils.",

            "The addition of an auxiliary small foil can significantly enhance the propulsive performance of the main foil. Based on vorticity dynamics, three main flow regimes are identified, depending on the vortex structures shed by the airfoils. The auxiliary airfoil's presence significantly alters the main airfoil's hydrodynamic characteristics, leading to considerable enhancements in thrust (up to 23%) and efficiency (up to 49.2%) compared to an isolated airfoil.",

Their market value is rapidly increasing due to their high sensitivity and the potential to design versatile probes to detect various parameters. In practical applications, the performance of such sensor probes is affected by the external field noise and low amplitude of the external field. In order to improve their real time performance in complex environments, the modulation or conditioning of their responses is a definite solution. In this regard, methods based on spatial signal processing or phase noise cancellation have been reported. However, amplification, attenuation of noise components and filtering using a single system remained elusive. ",

The sensing arm is exposed to an external measurand field while an equivalent field about the reference arm is applied in a controlled manner to modulate the resultant signal and achieve signal amplification, attenuation of unwanted frequencies, and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the output waveform. Real-time amplification, attenuation, and filtering of the dynamic optical response of sensor probes over a broad frequency range is feasible.
